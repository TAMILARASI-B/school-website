              <h6>20-March-2024</h6>
              <p>Set of facilities that the school provides to students, teachers and parents.

              <h2>Smart class Facilities:</h2>
              <h6>20-March-2024</h6>
              <p>Visual communication is one of the best ways to share the information. Smart class is the technology adopted to teach the students using visual communication. All the class rooms in our school are equipped with smart class technology. We have both slides and videos to teach our students.
                A psychologist, Jerome Bruner (as cited in Paul Martin Lester, 1994-1996) reveals that people remember a good 80% of things they see as compared to 20% to that they read and 10% of what they hear.
                Educational researchers suggesting that 83% of human learning occurs visually
                Most often teachers in many educations institutes admit that gaining attention of their students is a challenge but getting them to remember what was taught in the lesson is a much more difficult task. Receivers may forget the message and have difficulty recalling the message.</p>
